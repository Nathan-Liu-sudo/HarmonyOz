# Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite + DaisyUI(tailwindcss) + element plus

node -v 18.17.0

use apache echart to generate bar chart and map(use vic geojson, store on cloudfare r2 with gzip)
why not use leaflet? Because I saw a conflict on their github issues page
use vue-router(h5 mode) and <keep-alvie> make sure diversity page would not be destroyed until refresh

use auto import for element plus(just for selector-v2)
